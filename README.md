# Installing

This depends on using V's Fix for MGS2, as it already sets up ASI loading. You can get the fix from V's repo here: https://github.com/VFansss/mgs2-v-s-fix

If you have the GOG version of the game, this mod is untested, but feedback is highly valued.

Place the .ASI file in the games install path.

```%MGS2Path%\bin\scripts\mgs2_torture.asi```

# Building

The project was created in Visual Studio 2019 Community. You'll at the very least need to be able to build Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) projects using C++.
